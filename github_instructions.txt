GitHub Push Instructions

1. Your changes have been successfully committed to your local repository with the message:
   "Add critical priority option with glowing effect and enhance AI chat functionality"

2. To push your changes to GitHub, you need to authenticate. Here are a few options:

Option 1: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)
---------------------------------------
Run: gh auth login
Then: git push

Option 2: Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)
---------------------------------------------
1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new token
2. Give it a name, set an expiration, and select the 'repo' scope
3. Copy the token
4. When pushing, use the token as your password:
   git push https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/WILLIAMSTAMP/KanB.ai.git main

Option 3: Set up SSH keys
------------------------
1. Generate an SSH key: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
2. Add the key to your GitHub account
3. Change the remote URL to use SSH: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:WILLIAMSTAMP/KanB.ai.git
4. Push: git push

Your changes are safely committed locally, so you won't lose any work. Once you've set up authentication, you can push your changes to GitHub.
